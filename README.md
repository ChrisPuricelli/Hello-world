# Hello-world
Test repository, no .gitignores
Attempting to learn how to use github... Testing making changes and committing them to the master branch.

***

## Attempt at an H2 header, this will be in the README.md (must add a space after the # in order for it to apply)
#### Attempt at an H4 header, this will be in the second .md file
- **Trying to make bold text**
- *Trying to make italicized text*
- ~~Trying to make strike through text~~
- Also attempting to put all of this in a listed format
1. This is a different list, this list will be in the second .md file
   - Attempting a nested list as well
2. This will be the second line of the numbered list

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| This is  | A table  |
| Example  | Only     |

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| --- | --- |
| Trying a modified table | Where there is no specific width predesignated for the columns
| Did it work? | We'll find out shortly |

Block quote attempt:
>One of these days.
>I will be proficient in using github and all of the markdown information
>I'm attempting to learn it now.
>However, I'm not sure I'm doing everything correctly.
>I will probably put this block quote into the second .md file.

Attempt at a link to an external website:
[Googled a collapsing star](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=HqeIW5DBJ4XejwS6wJiIDA&btnG=Search&q=collapsing+star#imgrc=YxW-u_DKqZGF9M:)


Now attempting to load a picture that's located in the directory:
![black hole](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32752247/44890671-e74b0b80-aca0-11e8-870d-5dbfdfd655d0.jpg)
Created an issue and then dragged pic from my files to the content, it turned it into an image file that I put here. It worked.

This will be a simple link to a different website:
[Google](https://google.com)

Added link to secondary file:
[Link to file](https://github.com/ChrisPuricelli/Hello-world/blob/master/Helloworld%20secondary%20file.md)

Now trying my hand at block code:
```C
int main(void)
{
   printf("Hello World!\n");
   return 0;
}
```
